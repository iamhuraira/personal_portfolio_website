## Overview

I am creating a portfolio website using React, Framer Motion, the React Slider library, simple CSS, and a contact page using emailjs.

The website will feature subtle animations and transitions using Framer Motion, and the React Slider library will allow me to display a range of my work in a modern way. Simple CSS will be used to add custom styles and create a cohesive design throughout the website.

The contact page, powered by emailJs, will make it easy for potential clients or employers to contact me directly through the website.

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and experience as a developer. Here, you will find a variety of projects I've worked on, as well as information about my background and qualifications. Whether you're looking to hire me for a project or simply want to learn more about my work, this website is the perfect place to start. You can see the live version of my site by visiting the link. So take a look around, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or want to connect.


I will also be adding a dynamic dashboard to the website, so visitors can see it in action and get a better understanding of my capabilities.
